require "./label"

module Spectator
  # Represents an expression from a test.
  # This is typically captured by an `expect` macro.
  # It consists of a label and the value of the expression.
  # The label should be a string recognizable by the user,
  # or nil if one isn't available.
  #
  # This base class is provided so that all generic sub-classes can be stored as this one type.
  # The value of the expression can be retrieved by down-casting to the expected type with `#cast`.
  #
  # NOTE: This is intentionally a class and not a struct.
  # If it were a struct, changes made to the value held by an instance may not be kept when passing it around.
  # See commit ca564619ad2ae45f832a058d514298c868fdf699.
