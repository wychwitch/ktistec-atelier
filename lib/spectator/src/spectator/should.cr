class Object
  # Extension method to create an expectation for an object.
  # This is part of the spec DSL and mimics Crystal Spec's default should-syntax.
  # A matcher should immediately follow this method, or be the only argument to it.
  # Example usage:
  # ```
  # it "equals the expected value" do
  #   subject.should eq(42)
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # An optional message can be used in case the expectation fails.
  # It can be a string or proc returning a string.
  # ```
  # subject.should_not be_nil, "Shouldn't be nil"
  # ```
  #
  # NOTE: By default, the should-syntax is disabled.
  # The expect-syntax is preferred,
  # since it doesn't [monkey-patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) all objects.
  # To enable should-syntax, add the following to your `spec_helper.cr` file:
  # ```
  # require "spectator/should"
  # ```
