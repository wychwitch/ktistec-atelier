# Base class that all test cases run in.
# This type is used to store all test case contexts as a single type.
# The instance must be downcast to the correct type before calling a context method.

# The reason for this is to prevent name collision when using the DSL to define a spec.
abstract class SpectatorContext
  # Produces a dummy string to represent the context as a string.
  # This prevents the default behavior, which normally stringifies instance variables.
  # Due to the sheer amount of types Spectator can create
  # and that the Crystal compiler instantiates a `#to_s` and/or `#inspect` for each of those types,
  # an explosion in method instances can be created.
  # The compile time is drastically reduced by using a dummy string instead.
